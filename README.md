## Inspiration
The optimism of the an individual lies in their mental health. Studies say that people who balance both their physical and mental health have a great sense of self esteem. One of the notable methods to ameliorate our mental health is to listen to pleasing music. Last month, researchers found that music releases dopamine, the feel-good chemical in your brain. It also found that dopamine was up to 9% higher when volunteers listened to music that they enjoyed. It may be obvious to us, but it is strong evidence for the link between music and mental wellbeing. Especially when we hear the tunes of the piano our Stress reduction is abbreviated phenomenally. According to Toyoshima, playing the piano can lower cortisol levels and decrease a personâ€™s anxiety level.
